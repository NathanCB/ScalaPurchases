# ScalaPurchases
**As a business owner** <br>
**I want** to input a category of items that I sell<br>
**so that** I can print a list of customers purchase data for a chosen category.

### In Scala ###
Read and parse the CSV file of purchase data. <br>
Allow the user to filter the list by typing in a category name. <br>
Write the customer data for the chosen input category to a text file. <br> 
Use the chosen category as the output filename.
